                    I believe technology should amplify human potential, not replace it. My journey from a curious computer science student to a Google engineer to an aspiring entrepreneur has taught me that the most impactful solutions come from understanding real human problems deeply.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    At Google, I've seen how scale can multiply impact, but I've also learned that innovation often requires the agility and risk-taking mindset that comes from smaller, more nimble environments. This is why I'm drawn to the entrepreneurial pathâ€”not just for the freedom, but for the opportunity to build something from nothing and solve problems that matter.

                  <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                    I'm particularly excited about AI not because it's trendy, but because it represents a fundamental shift in how we can approach problem-solving. The key is to remain human-centered while leveraging these powerful tools to create better experiences and outcomes.
